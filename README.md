# Airbnb Clone Project

::: details BackEnd

## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. Learners will build a scalable web application while collaborating in team workflows and applying industry best practices.

## Learning Objectives

- **GitHub Collaboration**  
  Master branching, pull requests, code reviews, and collaborative workflows.
- **Backend & Database Design**  
  Deepen understanding of RESTful API design, ORM modeling, and relational schemas.
- **API Security**  
  Implement authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, and input validation.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Design automated testing, build, and deployment workflows.
- **Documentation & Planning**  
  Strengthen project documentation, architectural diagrams, and task breakdowns.
- **Tech Integration**  
  Integrate Django, GraphQL, MySQL, Docker, and CI/CD tools in a unified ecosystem.

## Requirements

- GitHub account
- Familiarity with Markdown for README authoring
- Prior experience with Django (or similar backend framework)
- Basic knowledge of MySQL (or another relational database)
- Understanding of software development lifecycle, security, and CI/CD
- Comfort with Docker and a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions)

## Key Highlights

- **Repository Management**  
  Initialize & structure a public GitHub repo with clear directories and README.
- **Team Roles**  
  Define responsibilities: backend, frontend, database, DevOps, QA, design, security.
- **Tech Stack Breakdown**  
  Document each technologyâ€™s role: Django for APIs, MySQL for data persistence, GraphQL for query flexibility.
- **Database Modeling**  
  Design entities, attributes, and relationships reflecting real-world booking logic.
- **Feature-Driven Development**  
  Outline core features with user flows and business logic impact.
- **Security Best Practices**  
  Apply OWASP principles: JWT auth, RBAC, CORS, CSRF protection, HTTPS enforcement.
- **Automated Deployments**  
  Set up Dockerized services and GitHub Actions to test, build, and deploy to AWS ECS.

## Database Design

| Entity         | Key Fields                                                              | Relationships                                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users**      | `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`                          | A user can own many Properties; can make many Bookings                           |
| **Properties** | `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night` | Each Property belongs to one User; has many Bookings & Reviews                   |
| **Bookings**   | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price` | A Booking belongs to one User and one Property; one-to-one with Payment & Review |
| **Reviews**    | `id`, `booking_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`                   | Each Review is linked to one Booking                                             |
| **Payments**   | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `processed_at`                  | Each Payment corresponds to one Booking                                          |
